# Boba Matching Algorithm 

We have skimmed through all the specific bobas reviews and found similarities to create a tag for it. For example, several Yelp reviews for a "Grapefruit Tea" had the word "refreshing", which became a tag representing its taste and feel. Then, we created tags for every boba and analyzed what they have in common. "BobaBliss" has strict tags, like "Lactose-free" and "Caffeine-free", and less strict tags like taste preferences. In the future, we could incorporate AI to help analyze more menu data and reviews.
